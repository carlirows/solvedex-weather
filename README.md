# SolvedexWeatherApp
this is my solution to the technical test for the front end developer position.
It was build using React, Vite, Jest and React Testing Library.
to run the proyect just create a folder with the name you prefer, then open your erminal in that location and run the following command 
git clone https://github.com/carlirows/solvedex-weather.git
once the repository has been cloned all you have to do is go to the root folder and run Yarn to install all dependencies,
once all the dependencies have been installed run yarn dev.
at this point you should be able to open and visualize the project using localHost
