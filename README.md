# SolvedexWeatherApp
this is my solution to the technical test for the front end developer position.<br>
It was build using React, Vite, Jest and React Testing Library.<br>
to run the proyect just create a folder with the name you prefer, then open your erminal in that location and run the following command <br>
git clone https://github.com/carlirows/solvedex-weather.git<br>
once the repository has been cloned all you have to do is go to the root folder and run Yarn to install all dependencies,<br>
once all the dependencies have been installed run yarn dev.<br>
at this point you should be able to open and visualize the project using localHost.<br>
There is a deployed version from the branch 'no-images' of the weather app available in :<br>
